Description: 
  Unifying of an inconsistently coded categorical variable between two different time points in accordance with a mapping table.
  The main rule is to replicate the observation if it could be assign to a few categories.
  Then using simple frequencies or statistical methods to approximate probabilities of being assign to each of them.
  This procedure was invented and implemented in the paper by (Nasinski, Majchrowska and Broniatowska (2020) <doi:10.24425/cejeme.2020.134747>).
