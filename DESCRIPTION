Description: 
    Unifying an inconsistently coded categorical variable between two different time points in accordance with a mapping table. 
    The main rule is to replicate the observation if it could be assigned to a few categories. 
    Then using frequencies or statistical methods to approximate the probabilities of being assigned to each of them. 
    This procedure was invented and implemented in the paper by Nasinski, Majchrowska, and Broniatowska (2020) <doi:10.24425/cejeme.2020.134747>.
