Description: 
  Transform a categorical variable according to a new encoding. 
  The main rule is to replicate the observation if it could be assign to a few categories.
  Then using simple freqencies or ml model to approximate probabilities of being assign to each of them.
  There was offered an automatic method to map a certain category variable according to a specified encoding across different time points.
