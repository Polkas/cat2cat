\title{Transforming a transition table with mappings to two associative lists}
\usage{
get_mappings(x = data.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{`data.frame` or `matrix` - transition table with 2 columns where first column is assumed to be the older encoding.}
}
\value{
a list with 2 named lists `to_old` and `to_new`.
}
\description{
to rearrange the one classification encoding into another, an associative list that maps keys to values is used.
More precisely, an association list is used which is a linked list in which each list element consists of a key and value or values.
An association list where unique categories codes are keys and matching categories from next or previous time point are values.
A transition table is used to build such associative lists.
}
\details{
the named list will be a more efficient solution than hash map as we are not expecting more than a few thousand keys.
}
\examples{
data(trans)

mappings <- get_mappings(trans)
mappings$to_old[1:4]
mappings$to_new[1:4]
}
